# statistics

Intro-stats materials made with [R/exams](http://www.r-exams.org/). Students use R or spreadsheet formulas. Questions use embedded csv files and have links to wikipedia. In addition to density curves and cumulative curves, I make heavy use of spinners to visualize the concepts.

Please preview the questions on my [static github site](https://ceworley.github.io). You can see the script I used to generate that static site in [allprobs](https://github.com/ceworley/statistics/tree/main/allprobs).

I use Moodle. I like to render a set of examples that every student sees and make video explanations for these. Then, I render ~100 versions as random exercises.

There are also a couple Shiny apps. I hope to make more soon.

Obviously, this is still very much a work in progress.
