# statistics
Intro-stats materials made with [R/exams](http://www.r-exams.org/){target="_blank"}. Students use R or spreadsheet formulas. Questions use embedded csv files and have links to wikipedia.

In addition to density and cumulative curves, I make heavy use of spinners to visualize the concepts.

I use Moodle. I like to render a set of examples that every student sees and make video explanations for these. Then, I render ~100 versions as randomly "generated" exercises.

There are also a couple Shiny apps. I hope to make more soon.

Obviously, this is still very much a work in progress.
