# statistics

Intro-stats materials made with [R/exams](http://www.r-exams.org/). Students use R or spreadsheet formulas. Questions use embedded csv files and have links to wikipedia. In addition to density curves and cumulative curves, I make heavy use of spinners to visualize the concepts.

Please preview the questions on my [static github site](https://ceworley.github.io). You can see the script I used to generate that static site in [allprobs](https://github.com/ceworley/statistics/tree/main/allprobs).

There are also a couple Shiny apps. They are rough, but my students prefer using them to using tables. You can preview them:

1. [Normal probabilities](http://18.191.167.248:3838/nprob/)
2. [T-dist probabilities](http://18.191.167.248:3838/Tprob/)
3. [Central-limit-theory probabilities](http://18.191.167.248:3838/CLTprob/)

If you plan to regularly use these Shiny apps, please host them yourself. I can't afford a flood of traffic. 

Obviously, this is still very much a work in progress.
