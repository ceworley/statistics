Question
========

A farm produces 4 types of fruit: `r fs[1]`, `r fs[2]`, `r fs[3]`, and `r fs[4]`. The fruits' masses follow normal distributions, with population parameters dependent on the type of fruit.

| _ Type of fruit _ | _ Mean mass (g) _ | _ Standard deviation of mass (g) _ |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|`r fs[1]` | `r mus[1]` | `r sigs[1]` | 
|`r fs[2]` | `r mus[2]` | `r sigs[2]` |
|`r fs[3]` | `r mus[3]` | `r sigs[3]` |
|`r fs[4]` | `r mus[4]` | `r sigs[4]` |

One specimen of each type is weighed. The results are shown below.

| _ Specimen type _ | _ Mass of specimen (g) _ |
|:---:|:---:|
|`r f[1]` | `r xs[1]` |
|`r f[2]` | `r xs[2]` |
|`r f[3]` | `r xs[3]` |
|`r f[4]` | `r xs[4]` |

The population parameters and specimen masses can be [downloaded as a csv](fruit.csv){target="blank"}.

For each measurement, determine the [standard score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score) and the [cumulative probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function){target="blank"}. Then determine which specimen is most unusually large, most unusually small, most typically sized, and most unusually sized.

The formula to determine the $z$-score of a **measurement** is the ratio with numerator the difference between measurement and population mean and denominator the population standard deviation.

$$z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} $$

The highest $z$-score (furthest right on [number line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_line){target="blank"}) corresponds to the most unusually large measurement. 

The smallest $z$-score (furthest left on [number line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_line){target="blank"}) corresponds to the most unusually small measurement.

The smallest [**absolute**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value){target="blank"} $z$-score corresponds to the most usually sized measurement.

The largest [**absolute**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value){target="blank"} $z$-score corresponds to the most unusually sized measurement.

* We use the formula for calculating the `r f[1]` specimen's $z$ score.
$$z = \frac{`r xs[1]`-`r mus[1]`}{`r sigs[1]`} = `r zs[1]` $$
* Use the $z$ table to find the cumulative probability
$$P(Z<`r zs[1]`) = `r ps[1]` $$
* We use the formula for calculating the `r f[2]` specimen's $z$ score.
$$z = \frac{`r xs[2]`-`r mus[2]`}{`r sigs[2]`} = `r zs[2]` $$
* Use the $z$ table to find the cumulative probability
$$P(Z<`r zs[2]`) = `r ps[2]` $$
* We use the formula for calculating the `r f[3]` specimen's $z$ score.
$$z = \frac{`r xs[3]`-`r mus[3]`}{`r sigs[3]`} = `r zs[3]` $$
* Use the $z$ table to find the cumulative probability
$$P(Z<`r zs[3]`) = `r ps[3]` $$
* We use the formula for calculating the `r f[4]` specimen's $z$ score.
$$z = \frac{`r xs[4]`-`r mus[4]`}{`r sigs[4]`} = `r zs[4]` $$
* Use the $z$ table to find the cumulative probability
$$P(Z<`r zs[4]`) = `r ps[4]` $$
* We determine the maximum $z$ score is $`r max(zs)`$, which belongs to the `r f[zs==max(zs)]`.
