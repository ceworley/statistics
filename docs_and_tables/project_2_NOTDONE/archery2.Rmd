* Pick a spinner, any spinner (simulate something?)
* Calculate spinner average and spinner standard deviation
* Pick a sample size (over 30)
* Spin a sample, get the sample average or sample total
* Calculate sampling distribution's average and standard deviation (standard error)
* Repeat step 2 MANY times
* Get average of the sample averages or sample totals
* Get standard deviation of the sample averages or sample totals
