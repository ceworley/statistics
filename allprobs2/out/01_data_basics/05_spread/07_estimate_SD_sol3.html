<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Notice the bell has the smallest standard deviation for a given range. This is because many measurements are near the mean, and just a few are near the edges.</p>
<p>The bimodal has the largest standard deviation for a given range. This is because many measurements are near the edges, and just a few are near the mean.</p>
<p>The uniform distribution has about equal numbers of measurements near the mean and near the edges, so it has a standard deviation between the two other shapes (for a given range).</p>
<p>You’ll notice the bimodal estimate is probably the worst estimate. The estimate would be more accurate if none of the values were near the mean, and all the values were near the edge.</p>

By using the given formula, you’ll get an estimate of 42.5 for the mean. The actual mean is 42.5953932.
</li>
<li>
By using the formula, you’ll get an estimate of 10.1036297 for the standard deviation. The actual standard deviation is 10.1357694.
