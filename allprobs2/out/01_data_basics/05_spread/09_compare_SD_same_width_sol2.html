<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>All three distributions look like they have similar ranges (widths), but different shapes. So, we will use the fact that for a given range, bell shape has the smallest standard deviation and bimodal has the largest standard deviation. This is because a bell shape has many measurements near the middle, whereas the bimodal shape has many measurements near the edges of its interval.</p>

The distribution with its center sitting furthest left has the smallest mean. / . / .

The distribution with its center sitting furthest right has the largest mean. / . / .

<li>
The bell shape has the smallest standard deviation. It is this simple because all the distributions have the same range, but the bell has a higher fraction near its mean. / . / .

<li>
The bimodal shape has the largest standard deviation. It is this simple because all the distributions have the same range, but the bimodal shape has a higher fraction far from its mean. / . / .
