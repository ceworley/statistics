<p>First, it helps to sort the data. <span class="math display">\[\text{sort}(\mathbf{x}) = 81, 81, 84, 85, 85, 87, 87, 88, 88, 88\]</span></p>
<h3 id="r">R</h3>
<p>You could use R to sort the data:</p>
<pre><code>sort(c(87,87,85,88,85,88,84,81,88,81))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1] 81 81 84 85 85 87 87 88 88 88</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/531555871" target="_blank">Video of a similar problem solved with R</a></p>
<h3 id="spreadsheet">Spreadsheet</h3>
<p>You could also use a spreadsheet. Import the table into a spreadsheet. Then, highlight the column of measurements and use <code>Sort</code> function.</p>

<li>
<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=2) There are 2 measurements between 80.5 and 83.5. <span class="math display">\[\#[80.5&lt;\mathbf{x}&lt;83.5]=2\]</span> </div>
</li>
<li>
<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=2) There are 2 measurements outside 83.5 and 89.5. <span class="math display">\[\#[\mathbf{x}&lt;83.5\texttt{ OR } \mathbf{x}&gt;89.5]=2\]</span> </div>
</li>
<li>
<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=1) There are 1 measurements closer than 1.5 units from 83. It might help to rephrase the problem as finding how many measurements are between 81.5 and 84.5. These boundaries are found by subtracting 1.5 from 83 and adding 1.5 to 83. <span class="math display">\[\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-83\big|&lt;1.5\right]=1\]</span> </div>
</li>
<li>
<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=2) There are 2 measurements farther than 4 units from 85.5. It might help to rephrase the problem as finding how many measurements are outside 81.5 and 89.5. These boundaries are found by subtracting 4 from 85.5 and adding 4 to 85.5. <span class="math display">\[\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-85.5\big|&gt;4\right]=2\]</span> </div>
</li>
<li>
<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=2) You can guess and check until you find an integer that satisfies the equation. It turns out that <span class="math inline">\(r = 2\)</span> satisfies the equation, because <span class="math inline">\(\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-82.5\big|&lt;2\right] ~=~ 3\)</span>. Notice the boundaries are 80.5 and 84.5, which are found by adding/subtracting 2 to/from 82.5. <span class="math display">\[\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-82.5\big|&lt;2\right] ~=~ 3\]</span> </div>
</li>
<li>
<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=3) You can guess and check until you find an integer that satisfies the equation. It turns out that <span class="math inline">\(r = 3\)</span> satisfies the equation, because <span class="math inline">\(\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-83.5\big|&gt;3\right] ~=~ 5\)</span>. Notice the boundaries are 80.5 and 86.5, which are found by adding/subtracting 3 to/from 83.5. <span class="math display">\[\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-83.5\big|&gt;3\right] ~=~ 5\]</span> </div>
