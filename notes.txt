I would like a library:
	draw target
	draw spinner
	draw spreadsheet
	make spreadsheet from uneven columns
	
can i not need \ after figures???
can I not need {target="blank"}???..



Eventually I want a static site for the class...

but with ability to update (quiz) questions each semester, or host multiple versions...

example - worked problem
exercises - a list of problems with answers: work is submitted
quiz - a list of problems (100 versions) without answers

or... I host my class as a Shiny??

Moodle.


But, I'd like a static site for sharing resources.
